My project repository for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/) [Data Science](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) course.

_Note_ - If you would like to run this code on your own machine, make sure that you set your working directory to the 'code' directory. Also, I have included sample data for your convenience. You can also download the [full data set](http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/) if you are interested.
